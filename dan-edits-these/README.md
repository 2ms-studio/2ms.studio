Dear Dan,

feel free to edit these to your heart's content. You can do it directly on github if you want. Make sure you "Commit directly to the master branch", then the changes should go live after a few minutes.

-   [images](images) any images you want to use. See README in there.
-   [bio.md](bio.md) content for the biography page
-   [design.mdx](design.mdx) hopefully it's clear from what's there now? Shout if not.
-   [meta.json](meta.json) site meta info that goes in various `<head></head>` bits
-   [press.md](press.md) the list of press links, formatted in markdown

Warm regards,

Alex
