Dear Dan,

feel free to edit these to your heart's content. You can do it directly on github if you want. Make sure you "Commit directly to the master branch", then the changes should go live after a few minutes.

-   [bio.md](bio.md) content for the biography page
-   [meta.json](meta.json) site meta info that goes in various `<head></head>` bits
-   [press-links.json](press-links.json) the list of URLs that are scraped for the homepage

Warm regards,

Alex
